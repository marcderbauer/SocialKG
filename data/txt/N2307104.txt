the United Nations in supporting the implementation of its provisions,

conclude swiftly negotiations on a comprehensive peace agreement, and calling upon
all international actors to continue encouraging non-participatory parties in this
regard,

of the renewal of ceasefire throughout the Republic of the Sudan on all fronts and for
all groups, expressing concern about the worsening humanitarian situation in Darfur

law and continued displacement,
Noting with concern reports by the Panel of Experts on the Sudan that armed
actors are engaged in aggressive recruitment campaigns, and encouraging the

offices in the five states of Darfur, beginning expedited DDR per the JPA, expanding
support to the PCC, and operationalizing the Joint Specialized Technical Committee,
Welcoming the signing of the Sudan Political Framework Agreement on

supporting Sudanese efforts to restore a lasting, inclusive and democratic political
settlement in Sudan, calling upon all stakeholders to reaffirm their commitment to
