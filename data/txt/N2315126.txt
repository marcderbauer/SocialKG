Resolution 2683 (2023)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 9332nd meeting,
on 30 May 2023
The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions, statements of its President, and press
statements on the situation in South Sudan,
Affirming its support for the 2018 “Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of
the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan” (the Revitalised Agreement), stressing
that the peace process only remains viable with the full commitment by all parties,
urging the full implementation without delay of the Revitalised Agreement and of the
Agreement on the Roadmap to a Peaceful and Democratic end to the Transitional
Period of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic
of South Sudan, and noting with concern the delayed implementation of the
Revitalised Agreement, which necessitated a further two-year extension of the
transitional political arrangements,
Welcoming encouraging developments in the implementation of elements of the
Revitalised Agreement, including the completion of the first phase of the training and
graduation of the Necessary Unified Forces, the drafting of documents required in
stage 1 of the Strategic Defence and Security Review, and on training, awareness-
raising, and sensitization for the implementation of the Joint Action Plan for the
Armed Forces on addressing conflict-related sexual violence,
Expressing appreciation for the leadership of the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development (IGAD) in advancing the peace process in South Sudan, welcoming
the resumption of mediation by the Community of Sant’Egidio to foster political
dialogue between signatories and non-signatories of the Revitalised Agreement, and
calling on South Sudanese parties to demonstrate the political will to peacefully
resolve the outstanding differences that are driving continued violence,
Expressing concern over the continued intensification of violence prolonging
the political, security, economic, and humanitarian crisis in most parts of the country,
condemning the mobilization of armed groups and encouragement of defections,
including by members of the government forces and armed opposition groups, and
further recognizing that intercommunal violence in South Sudan is politically and
economically linked to national-level violence and corruption,
Underscoring the need for the parties to avoid a relapse into widespread conflict
and respect the agreed command structure arrangement, and stressing the need to
expeditiously finalize the security arrangements set out in Chapter II of the
Revitalised Agreement, including by ensuring regular and adequate payment of
salaries to the Necessary Unified Forces, consistent with the budgetary outlays to the
National Security Service and of the South Sudan Presidential Guard Unit, and by
assigning clear missions to these forces in keeping with the Strategic Defense and
Security Review (SDSR) process contained in the Revitalised Agreement,
Expressing deep concern at continued fighting in South Sudan, condemning
repeated violations of the Revitalised Agreement and the Agreement on Cessation of
Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access (ACOH), strongly
condemning all fighting, including violence in Upper Nile, Jonglei, and Central
Equatoria states, and demanding that parties that violate the ACOH be held
accountable in accordance with their obligations under the ACOH and Revitalised
Agreement,
Strongly condemning past and ongoing human rights violations and abuses and
violations of international humanitarian law by all parties, including by armed groups
and national security forces, as well as the incitement to commit such abuses and
violations, and the alarming surge in conflict-related sexual violence, which is a basis
for designation, as described in paragraph 15 (e) of resolution 2521 (2020), further
condemning harassment, targeting, and censorship of civil society, including
journalists, human rights defenders, humanitarian personnel, and media
correspondents, emphasizing that those responsible for violations of international
humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights must be held
accountable, and that the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity
(RTGNU) bears the primary responsibility to protect its population from genocide,
war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and expressing concern
that, despite the signing of the Revitalised Agreement, violations and abuses including
those involving gender-based violence continue to occur, which may amount to
international crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity,
Expressing its alarm and deep concern over continued armed violence against
humanitarian workers and facilities, and food convoys that resulted in the deaths of
at least 20 humanitarian workers and volunteers and nearly 50 security incidents since
January 2023, and the looting and destruction of life-saving assistance, strongly
condemning all instances of violence against humanitarians, expressing grave concern
at the imposition of taxes and illegal fees which hamper the delivery of humanitarian
assistance across the country, stressing the detrimental impact of continued insecurity
on humanitarian operations across the country, encouraging all parties to allow and
facilitate safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access to people in need, and
calling on RTGNU to protect humanitarian personnel and create a safe and enabling
environment for humanitarian assistance, consistent with international humanitarian
law and its obligations under the Revitalised Agreement,
Expressing grave concern regarding increased violence between armed groups
in some parts of South Sudan, which has killed and displaced thousands, and
condemning the mobilization of such groups by parties to the conflict,
Expressing deep concern regarding the delays in implementing the Revitalised
Agreement, in particular calling for the use of a single Treasury account and the
required audits, reviews and additional tools for an oil marketing system that is open,
transparent, and competitive, as specified in Chapter 4 of the Revitalised Agreement,
calling on the parties to implement fully the Revitalised Agreement, including by
allocating the necessary financial resources, establishing transitional institutions
without delay, and ensuring full, equal, and meaningful participation of women and
inclusion of youth, faith groups, and civil society in all conflict resolution and
peacebuilding efforts, and to make progress on transitional reforms, including
establishing free and open civic space, an inclusive constitutional drafting process,
and economic transparency and public financial management reform, expressing deep
concern about the detrimental effect of corruption and misuse of public funds on the
RTGNU’s ability to provide services to its population, and further stressing the need
to enhance good economic governance to ensure effective national revenue collection
and anti-corruption structures in order to finance implementation of regulatory
framework essential for a political transition, and the humanitarian needs of the
population,
Appreciating that Member States continue to express clear intent to provide
technical assistance and capacity building to relevant authorities in South Sudan,
complying with the provisions of resolution 2428 (2018), in support of the
implementation of the Revitalised Agreement, and encouraging Member States to
provide support to the RTGNU on ammunition storage and armory control, with the
view to build South Sudan’s capacity in light of the benchmarks set out in paragraph 2
of resolution 2577 (2021),
Recalling the need for Member States to ensure that all measures taken by them
to implement this resolution comply with their obligations under international law,
including international humanitarian law, international human rights law and
international refugee law, as applicable,
Stressing that the measures imposed by this resolution are not intended to have
adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population of South Sudan, and
recalling paragraph 1 of resolution 2664 (2022), which states that the provision,
processing or payment of funds, other financial assets, or economic resources, or the
provision of goods and services, by certain entities or organizations, necessary to
ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance or to support other activities
that support basic human needs, are permitted and are not a violation of the asset
freeze,
Expressing deep concern at the findings and conclusions shared through the
Final 2023 report (S/2023/294) of the United Nations Panel of Experts, and stressing
that armed violence, impunity and misallocation of revenues can have a devastating
impact on society and individuals, weaken democratic institutions, undermine the rule
of law, perpetuate violent conflicts, facilitate illegal activities, divert humanitarian
assistance or complicate its delivery, and undermine economic markets,
Also expressing grave concern at the threat to peace and security in South Sudan
arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms
and light weapons, and further expressing concern that illicit trafficking and diversion
of arms and related materiel of all types undermine the rule of law and have the
potential to undermine respect for international humanitarian law, can impede the
provision of humanitarian assistance and have wide-ranging negative humanitarian
and socioeconomic consequences,
Acknowledging the cooperation by the South Sudanese authorities with the
Panel of Experts, and strongly encouraging the South Sudanese authorities to
continue their engagement with the Panel of Experts and prevent any obstruction to
the implementation of its mandate,
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on South Sudan arms embargo

Taking note of the Secretary-General’s report of 28 April 2023 (S/2023/300), as
